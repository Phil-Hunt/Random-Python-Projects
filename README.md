Leap Year Checker

The Leap Year Checker is a simple Python script that allows you to determine whether a given year is a leap year or not. A leap year is a year that is evenly divisible by 4, except for end-of-century years which must be divisible by 400. The script prompts the user to input a year and then performs the leap year check based on established rules.

How It Works:

The user is prompted to input a year using the input() function.

The script uses conditional statements to evaluate the year and check for leap year conditions:

If the year is divisible by 4 and not divisible by 100, it's a leap year.
If the year is divisible by 400, it's a leap year.
Depending on the evaluation, the script will display an appropriate message indicating whether the given year is a leap year or not.

Usage:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository folder.

Run the script using the command: python3 leap_year_checker.py

Input a year when prompted and observe the output indicating whether it's a leap year or not.
