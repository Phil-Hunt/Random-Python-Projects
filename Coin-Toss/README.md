Heads or Tails Virtual Coin Toss :coin:

The Heads or Tails Virtual Coin Toss is a very simple Python program that simulates flipping a coin. With each run, the program randomly selects either "Heads" or "Tails" and displays the result, providing a fun way to make decisions.

How It Works:

Run the program and press any key to initiate the coin toss.

The program uses the random module to generate a random integer (0 or 1), where 0 represents "Heads" and 1 represents "Tails."

Depending on the generated random integer, the program displays either "Heads" or "Tails."

Usage:

Clone or download to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository folder.

Run the script using the command: python3 heads_or_tails.py

Press any key to initiate the coin toss and see the result.
