Love Generator

The Love Generator is a fun Python script that calculates a "love score" between two names based on the letters in the phrase "true love." The script counts how many letters from "true love" are present in the two inputted names, adds them together, and provides a score that gives a playful indication of compatibility.

How It Works:

Run the script and follow the prompts.

Input the names of two individuals when prompted.

The script will count how many times the letters "t," "r," "u," "e," "l," "o," "v," and "e" appear in both names.

It adds up the counts for the letters from "true love" to calculate a "love score."

Depending on the calculated love score, the script displays a message that suggests how well the two names might go together.

Usage:

1. Clone or download to your computer.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository folder.

3. Run the script using the command: python3 Love_Generator.py

Follow the instructions to input the names and see the calculated love score.

Feel free to experiment with different names and have fun exploring your "love compatibility" using the Love Generator!
